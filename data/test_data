The [Chess.com Global Championship Finals](https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/news/1117123.aeb4f899.5000x5000o.ae72560bb40a.png) start on November 2, 2022! As the biggest online tournament of the year reaches its thrilling conclusion, the live finals are set to occur in two locations: Toronto, Canada, and Belgrade, Serbia. The CGC Finals field includes no less than seven former Candidates and one of the top juniors in the world. GMs Hikaru Nakamura, Anish Giri, Wesley So, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, and Sam Sevian will be in Toronto, along with the hosts, while GMs Teimour Radjabov, Nihal Sarin, and Dmitry Andreikin will meet in Belgrade. Players will face each other over computers as they play for the $200,000 first-place prize and the title of Chess.com Global Champion. 

Unfortunately, Chess.com is not able to accommodate a live audience in the playing venue in Toronto, due to fair play and production limitations. In 2021, FIDE approved ratings for "hybrid" events, those played on a network in a physical location with arbiters on site, like the CGC. Because of this, the games will all count towards the players' official FIDE rapid ratings, adding a little extra stake to the event.

####**Format/Time Controls**

* Players compete in a single-elimination bracket.

* Matches consist of eight 15+2 rapid games

* If the match ends in a tie, a single rapid armageddon game determines the winner. White gets 15 minutes and must win, with a bidding system to determine who plays Black with draw odds. Players communicate privately the amount of time they are willing to get to play as Black; the lower time offered wins the bid, and that player starts with the amount of time bid. If the bid is tied, the higher-seeded player chooses the color.

**ST. LOUIS** - The [2022 Fall Chess Classic](https://i.imgur.com/tb4A6QH.png) is the third installment of the Chess Classics featuring international chess professionals. The Fall Chess Classic is comprised of two, 10-player Round Robin tournaments. Over the course of 10 days, these competitors will battle for more than $36,000 in prize money and gain valuable experience in top-level events. The Classic Series at the Saint Louis Chess Club was created so strong international masters and grandmasters could participate in classical round robin tournaments in which to test their mettle against players of similar levels and to learn from these experiences.

Title: In April 2014, Carlsen's 100-game performance rating reached 2900 for a duration of 2 games (likely the only time in history that this has been achieved). 
Body: The idea with continuous performance rating is to take a list of consecutive games and calculate the performance rating (Rp) value for a fixed number of most recent games while moving along the list. For example, below are graphs that show the 15-game Rp for the last 150 games of Carlsen, Caruana, Firouzja, Niemann, Keymer and Gukesh:

In this manner, a 100-game Rp graph was produced for the last 739 games of Carlsen (1/2010-10/2022):

https://preview.redd.it/fldvgbmcsix91.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f5fd9e4c43a4920e9f0bcc92e66904a38e1fa21

Carlsen's FIDE Rp reaches the 2900 level 3 times (2 times in a row 2904 and a bit later 2900). The important distinction is that these graphs show the [FIDE performance rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rating_(chess)#FIDE_performance_rating), which is the one commonly used to calculate tournament performances, but which isn't exactly the same as the ”true” performance rating. I checked the true Rp values for every case where the FIDE Rp was 2870 or higher. Below is a zoomed in version of the highest section:

https://preview.redd.it/1cqx9lulsix91.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=5203f21d199bb4abb1cde55538c0083639b956d3

There are two sets of 100 consecutive games that have true performance ratings over 2900 (calculated with [Performance calculator](http://chess.kivij.info/performance_calculator.shtml)).

|Game #1|Game #100|Score (avg. opp. rating)|FIDE Rp|True Rp|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2012/06/16 draw against Nakamura|2014/04/21 win against Nakamura|69.5/100 (2755)|2904|2902|
|2012/06/17 draw against Tomashevsky|2014/04/22 draw against Karjakin|69.5/100 (2755)|2904|2901|

[This](https://2700chess.com/games/carlsen-nakamura-r2-shamkir-2014-04-21) is the April 21 game against Nakamura. There is also a [post-game press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJavso9l3iY) on youtube (the answer to the [10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJavso9l3iY&t=10m35s) question is quite funny).

Since the ”fractional score” element of the FIDE Rp is calculated on a 2-decimal basis, the resolution isn't high enough to differentiate half-point steps at 100-game level. As a consequence, scores that contain half a point tend to be slightly overvalued. E.g. Carlsen's FIDE Rp for the score 69.5 is the same (2904) as it would be for the score 70.0, because the fractional score is rounded to 0.70 in both cases.

This is (almost certainly) the only time in history that a player has reached 2900 Rp in 100 consecutive classical games, and it's quite remarkable how narrow the margin was: during the 99-game period from June 2012 (Tomashevsky game) to April 2014 (Nakamura game), had Carlsen drawn one of the games he won or lost one of the games he drew, he wouldn't have ever reached 2900 (e.g. had he drawn the April 21 game against Nakamura, his highest FIDE Rp value would have ended up being 2899).

List of opponent ratings for the first set (the second set has the last figure (2775) replaced by 2772):

>2772 2760 2553 2773 2782 2789 2812 2777 2775 2775 2775 2775 2775 2775 2775 2775 2775 2775 2813 2772 2741 2772 2813 2741 2753 2784 2760 2755 2786 2713 2774 2782 2803 2813 2743 2608 2745 2767 2769 2775 2783 2793 2747 2793 2757 2764 2740 2810 2809 2793 2747 2757 2764 2740 2810 2809 2726 2769 2752 2627 2603 2780 2735 2667 2772 2698 2679 2802 2781 2775 2760 2705 2710 2644 2795 2815 2713 2816 2780 2778 2697 2773 2780 2816 2778 2697 2773 2713 2696 2732 2739 2778 2713 2696 2732 2739 2778 2706 2738 2775
